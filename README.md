# ME3FOVFixer
A utility to easily apply the FOV fix to Mass Effect 3's coalesced.bin

# Important Disclaimer
I wrote this utility for my own use (normally just after fresh installing ME3), and as such it's pretty dumb. It doesn't *modify* coalesced.bin, but replaces it with the default coalesced.bin with the modification applied. This means that if you've made your own modifications to coalesced.bin, they will be reset to default when you run this utility. It *does*, however:

* Make a backup of your coalesced.bin (`coalesced.bin.youroriginal`)
* Add a copy of the default coalesced.bin (`coalesced.bin.original`)
* Add a copy of the default coalesced.bin with the FOV mod applied (`coalesced.bin.fovmod`)

So it's pretty safe to use.

# Usage

Before applying the fix, make sure you have the right Mass Effect 3 directory set. This **IS NOT** the installation directory of the game; it's the directory that stores your config data. Normally this is `C:\Users\<username>\Documents\BioWare\Mass Effect 3`. Once you have the right directory set, click the Go button and you're done.
